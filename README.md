## Filament Evaluation

Evaluation artifact for [Filament HDL][filament] presented in the paper ["Modular Hardware Design with Timeline Types"][fil-paper].

### Prerequisites

1. Install the Filament compiler (**TK**) and configure `fud`.
2. Install the [Vivado Synthesis Toolchain][vivado]. **Note**: The Vivado synthesis toolchain is large (~40 GB) and might take a long time to install. We encourage the reviewers to install this tool in advance.

### Step-by-step Instructions

The artifact reproduces Table 1 & 2 described in Section 7 of the paper.

The evaluation uses hardware designs generated by [Aetherling][] and [Reticle][]. The artifact already contains the Verilog generated by the tools. While we provide instructions to regenerate the Verilog files from those tools, we do not make claims about the continued functionality of those toolchains.

### Table 1: Aetherling Latencies

Table 1 compares the latencies reported by the Aetherling compiler with the latency that works with Filament's timing-accurate test harness.

### Table 2: Quantitative Comparison

Table 2 reports the resource usage of designs generated by Filament to ones generated by Aetherling and Reticle. This evaluation **requires** Vivado synthesis toolchains to be installed.
